## String Algorithms

### 1. Basic String Operations
* [x] **String Traversal**: Iterating through a string efficiently.
* [x] **Two-Pointer Technique**: Solving substring problems like sliding window.
* [x] **String Splitting/Parsing**: Breaking strings into components.

### 2. String Searching
* Substring Search:
  * [x] Naive Search: Compare substrings one by one. 
  * [x] Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP): Pattern matching using a prefix table. 
  * [ ] Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Uses hashing for substring search.
* [ ] Z-Algorithm: For pattern matching and constructing Z-array.
